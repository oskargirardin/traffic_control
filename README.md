# traffic_control
## TO DO
- Implement yellow light to help learning? Now it is possible that the action of GrGr is associated with a -1000 reward since there can still be cars on the crossing. Alternative: Change lights after x cars have passed (Ugo approach)?
- Plotting functions, functions to save training as json with parameters, score, history,...
